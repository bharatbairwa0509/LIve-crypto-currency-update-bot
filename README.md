Project Report: Live Cryptocurrency Data Updater
1. Project Overview: The "Live Cryptocurrency Data Updater" is an automated system that fetches real-time cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API and updates a Google Sheet at regular intervals. This enables users to access the latest market data without running a script manually.
2. Objectives:
â€¢	Automate the retrieval of cryptocurrency market data.
â€¢	Store and update data in a Google Sheet.
â€¢	Provide real-time access to users via a shareable Google Sheet link.
â€¢	Perform basic data analysis on the fetched data.
â€¢	Implement Google Apps Script to run the update process automatically.
3. Workflow:
1.	Fetching Data: 
o	A Python script fetches data from the CoinGecko API.
o	It retrieves the top 50 cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization.
2.	Data Processing: 
o	The script processes the data into a structured format.
o	Identifies the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap.
o	Calculates the average price of the top 50 cryptocurrencies.
o	Analyzes the highest and lowest 24-hour percentage price change.
3.	Google Sheets Integration: 
o	The script uses Google Sheets API to write data into specific sheets.
o	Separate sheets are maintained for live data, top 5 market cap, and summary analysis.
4.	Automation via Google Apps Script: 
o	A trigger function in Google Apps Script schedules periodic updates.
o	The script runs even when the Python script is not active.
5.	User Access: 
o	The Google Sheet is shared with users via a link, enabling them to see live updates.
o	Live updates can be accessed here: Live Crypto Data Sheet
4. Technologies Used:
â€¢	Python: For fetching and processing cryptocurrency data.
â€¢	CoinGecko API: Provides real-time cryptocurrency market data.
â€¢	Google Sheets API: Enables integration between Python and Google Sheets.
â€¢	Google Apps Script: Automates the sheet updates without requiring manual execution.
â€¢	GCP Service Account: Used for authentication to access Google Sheets.
â€¢	gspread Library: Python library to interact with Google Sheets.
â€¢	pandas Library: Used for data analysis and processing.
â€¢	schedule Library: Automates periodic execution of the Python script.
â€¢	Google Cloud Console: For Service Account & Authentication, Google Sheets API Enablement, Permissions & Access Control, Scalability & Security.
5. Automation & Deployment:
â€¢	A Python script is initially used to set up and validate data updates.
â€¢	Google Apps Script is deployed with a trigger to update the sheet at regular intervals.
â€¢	The Python script can be removed after setting up the automation in Google Apps Script.
â€¢	The sheet remains updated without manual intervention.
6. Error Handling & Rate Limits:
â€¢	The script checks for API response status and handles errors gracefully.
â€¢	A rate limit error (429) is mitigated by reducing the update frequency or subscribing to a premium API plan.
â€¢	If an API failure occurs, the script logs the error and retries later.
7. Expected Outcome:
â€¢	A fully automated Google Sheet with real-time cryptocurrency updates.
â€¢	Users can access live market data without running any script.
â€¢	Basic analysis provides insights into market trends.
â€¢	The system remains operational even after the Python script is removed.
8. Challenges Faced:
â€¢	Configuring Google Sheets API access and permissions.
â€¢	Handling API rate limits and request failures.
â€¢	Automating periodic updates using Google Apps Script.
9. Future Enhancements:
â€¢	Implement data visualization using Google Sheets charts.
â€¢	Add alerts for significant price changes.
â€¢	Expand to track additional metrics like historical trends and trading volume.
